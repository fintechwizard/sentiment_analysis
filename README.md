<b>Welcome to our Sentiment Analysis Application Demo!</b> This Python Flask application is designed to analyze sentiment using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and is a valuable tool for understanding public sentiment on social media platforms like X and Facebook.

## Application Overview

Our Sentiment Analysis application provides the following features:

- **Data Collection**: Easily scrape X for posts containing specified keywords and hashtags to gather relevant data.

- **Data Processing**: The collected posts undergo a pre-processing phase, where they are cleaned and tokenized, preparing them for analysis.

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Our NLP module analyzes the text data and assigns a sentiment rating of either positive, negative, or neutral, along with a corresponding value between one and zero.

- **Interpretation**: The application calculates an overall sentiment score based on the highest sentiment value, making it easy to gauge public sentiment on your chosen subject.
